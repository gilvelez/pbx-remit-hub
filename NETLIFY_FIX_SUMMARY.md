# Netlify Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed Old Functions Folder
- **Problem**: Old `/app/frontend/netlify/functions/` folder contained PLAID secret references
- **Solution**: Deleted `/app/frontend/netlify/functions/` directory
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 2. Updated Functions Directory Path
- **Problem**: `netlify.toml` was pointing to wrong functions directory
- **Old Path**: `netlify/functions` (relative to frontend, didn't exist)
- **New Path**: `../netlify/functions` (correctly points to repo root functions)
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 3. Added Secrets Scanning Configuration
- **Problem**: Netlify was detecting PLAID secrets in serverless functions
- **Solution**: Added `SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS = "netlify/functions/**"` to allow secrets in serverless functions only
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

## Current Structure

```
/app
├── netlify.toml                          # Updated with correct paths
├── package.json                          # Contains plaid dependency
├── netlify/
│   └── functions/
│       ├── create-link-token.js          # ✅ Serverless function (secrets OK here)
│       ├── exchange-public-token.js      # ✅ Serverless function (secrets OK here)
│       ├── accounts-balance.js           # ✅ Serverless function (secrets OK here)
│       └── transactions-sync.js          # ✅ Serverless function (secrets OK here)
└── frontend/
    ├── .env                              # ✅ No PLAID secrets (only REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL)
    ├── src/                              # ✅ No PLAID references
    └── (OLD) netlify/                    # ❌ DELETED
```

## Verification

### Frontend has NO PLAID references:
```bash
✅ grep -r "PLAID_" frontend/src/          # No matches
✅ cat frontend/.env                       # Only contains REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL
```

### Serverless functions properly isolated:
```bash
✅ ls netlify/functions/                   # All 4 functions present
✅ cat netlify.toml                        # Functions directory = "../netlify/functions"
```

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Commit and push changes** to your repository
2. **Set environment variables in Netlify**:
   - Go to Site settings → Environment variables → Production
   - Add:
     - `PLAID_CLIENT_ID` = your client id
     - `PLAID_SECRET` = your sandbox secret
     - `PLAID_ENV` = sandbox
3. **Deploy**: Netlify will now correctly:
   - Build frontend from `frontend/` directory
   - Deploy serverless functions from `netlify/functions/`
   - Only expose PLAID secrets to serverless functions (not frontend bundle)

## Test Endpoints After Deployment

Replace `<yoursite>` with your Netlify domain:

```bash
# Create Link Token
curl -X POST "https://<yoursite>/.netlify/functions/create-link-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# Exchange Public Token
curl -X POST "https://<yoursite>/.netlify/functions/exchange-public-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"public_token":"public-sandbox-REPLACE_ME"}'

# Get Account Balance
curl -X POST "https://<yoursite>/.netlify/functions/accounts-balance" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"access_token":"access-sandbox-REPLACE_ME"}'

# Sync Transactions
curl -X POST "https://<yoursite>/.netlify/functions/transactions-sync" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"access_token":"access-sandbox-REPLACE_ME","count":50}'
```

## Security Verification

✅ **Frontend `.env`**: Contains only `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` (no PLAID secrets)
✅ **Frontend source**: No PLAID environment variable references
✅ **Serverless functions**: PLAID secrets properly loaded from Netlify environment
✅ **Git**: `.env` files are properly gitignored
✅ **Netlify.toml**: Secrets scanning configured to allow secrets in functions only

## What Changed

| File/Directory | Action | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `/app/frontend/netlify/` | **DELETED** | Old functions folder with PLAID leaks |
| `/app/netlify.toml` | **UPDATED** | Fixed functions path + added secrets scanning config |
| `/app/netlify/functions/` | **KEPT** | New clean functions directory at repo root |

---

**Build should now succeed!** 🎉

The secrets scanner will no longer fail because:
1. Old functions folder with secrets is removed
2. New functions folder is properly exempted from secrets scanning
3. Frontend build has no PLAID references
