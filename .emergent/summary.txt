The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the PBX landing page, evolving it from a frontend-only mock to a full-stack application. Initial work focused on UI/UX with React, Tailwind, and Shadcn, incorporating interactive demo elements and a lead capture form. The backend was built with FastAPI and MongoDB for lead and session management, including mock integrations for Plaid and Circle, later integrating these with the frontend. Subsequent iterations addressed SEO, accessibility, and detailed content updates, including a significant hero section redesign in Filipino. The latter part of the trajectory focused extensively on preparing the application for Netlify deployment, tackling module resolution issues by switching between  and , configuring  for correct build paths and function directories, and diligently sanitizing environment variables to prevent secret leaks during the build process. The work concluded with an ongoing effort to refactor Netlify functions to the repository root for a cleaner structure and updated  configuration.

The primary objective is to develop a conversion-optimized MVP landing page for Philippine Bayani Exchange (PBX) to serve the Filipino diaspora.

**Implemented Features:**
*   **Landing Page:** Features a bilingual hero section (initially English, later refined to Filipino with a Philippine flag gradient), interactive demo for bank connections and fund transfers (using mock Plaid and Circle APIs), How It Works, Features, FAQ, and an email signup form for early access. Accessibility features like a Skip to content link and SEO meta tags have been added and refined.  attributes are present for analytics.
*   **Admin Page:** A basic interface to view and export collected email leads as CSV, secured by HTTP Basic Authentication.
*   **Design & UX:** Employs a clean, minimal design with Philippine flag colors (sky-blue, red, yellow accents) using Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide-react icons. Responsive design, smooth animations, and a comprehensive footer disclaimer are in place. A dedicated  component displays transfer calculations.
*   **Backend:** Built with FastAPI, MongoDB stores  and  data. APIs handle lead creation, retrieval (with admin auth), and session state. Mock Plaid (, , , ) and mock Circle () integrations simulate financial transactions. Security measures include rate limiting on  and secure CORS.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development:** React (CRA) for frontend, FastAPI for backend, MongoDB for data persistence.
-   **UI/Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Lucide-react for icons.
-   **Backend Technologies:** Pydantic models,  (async MongoDB driver),  (rate limiting), HTTP Basic Auth.
-   **Third-Party Integrations:** Plaid (mock and sandbox via Python SDK), Circle (mock API).
-   **Frontend Build/Deployment:**  (for Webpack customization and path aliases in CRA), , Netlify (for serverless functions and deployment).
-   **Security & DevOps:** CORS, environment variables, ,  for process management.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured into  (React) and  (FastAPI) directories.



*   ****: The main user-facing page. It has been extensively refactored and consolidated, incorporating a bilingual hero section with Philippine flag gradient, an About section,  demo, and updated informational sections (How It Works, Features, FAQ). It was converted from a Next.js-like TypeScript structure to a CRA-compatible JavaScript component.
*   ****: The root HTML file. Updated significantly for SEO, including new dynamic title, meta descriptions, Open Graph, and Twitter card tags.  and  were also added to the  directory.
*   ****: Configures Webpack aliases, specifically  to , crucial for  to resolve module paths correctly in the local development environment. This was toggled with  in  to troubleshoot Netlify builds.
*   ****: Updated to manage dependencies and build scripts, oscillating between  and  to debug Netlify deployment issues.  dependency was added.
*   ****: This new file at the root configures Netlify's build process, specifying the base directory (), publish directory (), functions directory (), and environment variables for secrets scanning (). It underwent multiple revisions to resolve build and secrets scanning errors.
*   ****: A new serverless function for Netlify, responsible for generating Plaid Link Tokens. It reads , , and  from environment variables, ensuring secrets are not exposed client-side.
*   ****: Another new Netlify serverless function for handling lead submissions, connecting to MongoDB using  and  from environment variables.
*   ****: A new FastAPI route to serve as a backend endpoint for generating Plaid Link Tokens within the Emergent platform, mirroring the Netlify function functionality.
*   ****: The main FastAPI app, updated to include the new  router and handle Plaid service initialization.
*   **Documentation Files**: Several markdown files (, , , etc.) were created to document deployment steps, environment variable handling, and troubleshooting.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing persistent Netlify deployment errors related to the  variable and other secrets being detected in the client-side bundle, despite efforts to omit paths and configure . The current challenge is to ensure that Plaid-related environment variables (, , ) are *only* available to the Netlify serverless functions and are not inadvertently included in the frontend build, which causes Netlify's secrets scanner to fail the deployment.

The last action involved a user instruction to implement a cleaner structure for Netlify functions by moving them from  to the repository root at  and updating the  file accordingly. This is an attempt to resolve the deployment issues by standardizing the function directory and ensuring  accurately reflects this new path, alongside ensuring  dependency is added to the root .

<optional_next_step>
Update  with the new structure and move Plaid functions to the repo root's  directory.
