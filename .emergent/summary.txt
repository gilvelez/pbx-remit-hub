<analysis>
My analysis of the trajectory reveals a complex and iterative development process, primarily focused on deploying a full-stack application to Netlify and integrating Plaid and Circle APIs. The initial phase established a React frontend and FastAPI backend for a landing page. However, the majority of the work involved a protracted struggle with Netlify deployment. The engineer cycled through numerous debugging steps: resolving secret leaks by moving functions and sanitizing environment variables, fixing Node.js version incompatibilities, correcting build commands (npm vs. yarn), and managing dependencies between the root and frontend packages.

This debugging journey led to several architectural pivots. Plan B was a major shift to a simplified, mock-based architecture to prove the end-to-end flow, which was later manually rolled back at the user's request. Following the rollback, the user provided a completely new frontend MVP, replacing the original landing page with a mock-data-driven Send Money and Wallet interface. My last action was to create the files for this new UI. The core challenge throughout was not the application logic itself, but the intricacies of the Netlify build environment, secrets management, and dependency resolution in a monorepo-like structure.

The goal is to build a Philippine Bayani Exchange (PBX) MVP. Initially, this was a conversion-optimized landing page with a bilingual hero section, an interactive demo for bank connections using mock Plaid/Circle APIs, and a lead capture form feeding into a simple admin panel.

However, due to significant deployment challenges and evolving requirements, the focus shifted. The project pivoted towards building a functional, mock-driven application to demonstrate the core user flow. The most recent implementation, provided directly by the user, is a React-based UI featuring:
- A **Send Money page:** Allows selecting a recipient, entering an amount, and confirming a transfer.
- A **Wallet page:** Displays USD and USDC balances and a list of recent transfer activities.
- **Mock Data:** The entire UI is driven by initial mock data for recipients, balances, and transfers, with client-side logic to simulate transfer success/failure and update balances optimistically.
- A placeholder Connect Bank button exists, intended to be wired to the Plaid integration.

This new UI effectively replaces the original landing page as the primary focus, prioritizing the interactive remittance flow over the initial static content and lead capture.

- **Key Challenges:** Debugging Netlify secret scanning, managing Node.js versions, resolving monorepo dependency conflicts (root vs. workspace), and configuring build commands.

The application is a monorepo-style project with separate  and  directories, supplemented by a root-level  directory for serverless functions.



- ** (Multiple Files)**:
    - **Summary:** This directory was completely overhauled to implement a new UI. The previous  and  have been superseded.
    - **Changes:** The following files were created to build a new mock-data-driven Send Money and Wallet interface: , , , , and components in .  now manages the application state and routing between the two new pages.

- ** (Multiple Files)**:
    - **Summary:** This directory contains all serverless functions for interacting with third-party APIs like Plaid and Circle. This isolates secret keys from the frontend build.
    - **Changes:** Numerous functions were added throughout the trajectory to support Plaid integration (, , etc.) and Circle integration (, , ). Debugging functions like  were also added.

- ****:
    - **Summary:** This is the most critical configuration file, controlling the entire Netlify build and deployment process.
    - **Changes:** This file underwent extensive and repeated modifications to:

- Replace the mock  function in  with calls to the real Circle/Plaid orchestrator functions.
- Remove obsolete frontend files like , , and  to clean up the codebase after the recent UI overhaul.

<current_work>
The most recent task involved a complete overhaul of the frontend application based on user-provided code. The previous landing page () and various demo pages have been replaced by a new, mock-driven UI focused on a core remittance flow.

I created a new set of React components and pages:
- ****: The new main application component, managing state for pages, balances, and transfers.
- ****: A page for users to select a recipient and send a mock payment. It contains a placeholder .
- ****: A page to display mock balances and a history of transfers.
- ****: Provides the initial state for recipients, balances, and transfers.
- ****: Contains UI components for the Send Money flow (, , ).

The current state is that these new UI files have been successfully created. The application is now a client-side only mock of the PBX wallet and send-money functionality. The next step is to connect this new UI to the backend Netlify Functions that were previously created.

<optional_next_step>
I will begin wiring the Plaid integration into the new UI by implementing the logic for the Connect Bank button in .
