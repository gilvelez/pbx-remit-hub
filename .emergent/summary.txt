<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a Philippine Bayani Exchange (PBX) MVP. The project has undergone several pivots:
1.  Initial build of a remittance platform with mocked Plaid and real PayMongo integration.
2.  Numerous UI and copy updates for compliance and marketing, culminating in a premium, Filipino-themed landing page and a consistent theme across the demo app screens (, , ).
3.  A final, major pivot to a new subscription-based business model. The user provided a detailed PDF () outlining the requirements for this new direction.

The current and most important goal is to implement the new frontend based on the subscription model described in the PDF. This involves creating new pages for pricing, onboarding, a new dashboard, and an FX simulator, and redesigning the landing page to reflect the new plans (Basic, Premium, SME, Enterprise).

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a React-based frontend. The codebase contains a fully styled (premium, Filipino-themed) landing page and themed application screens (, , ) from the *previous* remittance model. However, the agent has just begun the pivot to the new subscription model. It has created several new, but currently empty, files for the pages and components required by the new business model (e.g., , , , ). The routing in  has not yet been updated to include these new pages.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was at the very beginning of a major frontend overhaul based on a user-provided PDF. The goal is to shift the application from a remittance model to a subscription-based business model. The agent analyzed the PDF, planned the file structure, and executed a parallel tool call to create the initial set of empty files for the new pages and components.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. This is a complete rebuild of the application's purpose and UI, which will require comprehensive end-to-end testing of all new pages, components, and user flows once the implementation is complete.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   There are no outstanding bugs. The focus is entirely on the new feature implementation.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Implement New Subscription Model Frontend (P0)**
    -   **Description:** This is the primary, overarching task. The agent needs to populate the newly created files with React code to build the new subscription-based UI as specified in the user's PDF document.
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent needs to start writing code for the following components and pages, which are currently just empty shells:
        1.  
        2.  
        3.  
        4.  
        5.  
        6.  
        7.  
        8.  
        9.  Update  to reflect the new model.
        10. Update  to wire up all the new routes.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** This will create the foundational frontend for the new PBX subscription-based business model, ready for user review and further backend integration.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **(P1) Wire up Circle Integration:** This was a priority before the pivot. It will likely be needed for the backend of the new subscription model to handle custody of funds.
    -   **(P1) Implement PayMongo Webhooks:** Also a previous priority, this will be necessary to get status updates on real fund transfers for the new model.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **(P2) Code Cleanup:** The old remittance-specific pages (, ) and Netlify functions will become obsolete and should be removed once the new model is fully implemented and verified.
    -   **(P2) Implement Production Authentication:** The current mock session management needs to be replaced with a secure, production-grade authentication provider suitable for a subscription service.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Landing Page Fixes:**
    -   Finalized compliance text on the landing page (rate disclaimer, footer wording).
    -   Replaced the interactive demo card with a static Pricing Preview panel.
    -   Fixed the How PBX Works button to scroll smoothly to the correct section.
-   **Full Theming & Redesign:**
    -   Implemented a pixel-perfect landing page redesign based on a user-provided mockup, including creating and slicing image assets.
    -   Applied the new premium Filipino theme (colors, fonts, components) consistently across all existing app screens (, , ) to create a cohesive user experience.
    -   Fixed UI inconsistencies where form inputs on the  page were not adhering to the new light theme.
-   **Content & Branding Overhaul:**
    -   Updated all marketing copy on the landing page to be inclusive, U.S.-centric, and aligned with a new global positioning, removing all Filipino-exclusive language.
    -   Removed specific partner names (e.g., PayMongo) from the frontend UI, replacing them with partner-neutral language.
    -   Updated the pricing section to a clear 4-tier demo model as requested.
-   **Platform Compliance:**
    -   Successfully hid the Made with Emergent badge from the UI using global CSS.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None observed in this session. The previous issue with Netlify dev vs. deployed environments was not a factor in the recent UI-focused tasks.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, , Tailwind CSS.
-   **Backend:** Serverless via Netlify Functions (Node.js) for the old model. The new model is currently frontend-only.
-   **Architecture Pivot:** The project is undergoing a fundamental shift from a per-transaction remittance model to a multi-tiered subscription service model (B2C and B2B).

**key DB schema**
-   No database is used.

**changes in tech stack**
-   No change in technology, but a complete change in the application's business logic and feature set.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/**: All the new (currently empty) page files (, , etc.) that need to be implemented.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/FXSimulator.jsx**: The new (empty) component to be built.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.jsx**: Needs to be updated with routes for all the new pages.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/Landing.jsx**: Needs to be updated to reflect the new subscription model.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The entire application is being refactored to align with the new business model. Old pages like  will need to be deprecated or completely re-imagined within the context of the new .

**key api endpoints**
-   The Netlify function endpoints () are part of the old remittance model and are not relevant to the current frontend implementation task.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **PIVOT:** The project has completely pivoted. You are no longer building a simple remittance app. You are now building the frontend for a **subscription-based financial platform** with four tiers (Basic, Premium, SME, Enterprise).
-   **FOLLOW THE PDF:** The user provided a PDF with detailed instructions for the new business model. This is your source of truth. All new components (, , , ) must be built according to its specifications.
-   **MOCKED LOGIC:** All frontend logic for the new features (e.g., in the ) should be mocked for now. The focus is on building a client-ready, visually complete frontend.
-   **DEPRECATED CODE:** Be aware that much of the existing code in  (like ) and  relates to the old model. Do not get confused. Focus on building the new pages and components.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Plaid, OpenExchangeRates, PayMongo:** These exist in the old codebase but are **not** part of the current task. The new implementation is a frontend-only build.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None
-   **Known regressions:** None

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   N/A. The new implementation is not yet built. The previous mock login flow used any email and a 6-digit code.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   Nothing was forgotten. The agent was correctly following the user's instructions and had just started the major new task of implementing the subscription model frontend by creating the necessary files before the session ended.</analysis>
